# Knight-s-Move
This project, "Knight's Move," aims to develop a playable chess game in the C language, focusing on the practical application and efficient implementation of various data structures.
While powerful chess engines like Stockfish exist, they rely on highly complex, specialized techniques. Many beginner projects often lack a structured approach, which can lead to inefficient code. This project, however, will create a simpler, yet highly structured and educational, version. I will use a standard, well-documented board representation known as the 0x88 board, and implement key data structures to handle the game's logic. This approach, while not as complex as professional engines, provides a robust and educational framework for applying data structure principles to a challenging problem.
